A deep, resonant male voice in his 50s with a rich baritone quality. He speaks slowly and deliberately, with measured pauses and a soothing, authoritative cadence. His tone is serious but not stern, reminiscent of a documentary narrator guiding the listener through a story with gravitas and composure.
